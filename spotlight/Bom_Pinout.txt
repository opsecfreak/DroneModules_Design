Components and Connections

Battery and Holder:

Component: 18650 Battery Holder (LCSC: C128606)
Symbol: EasyEDA “Battery” symbol (3.7V nominal, ~2600mAh).
Connections:

Positive (BAT+) to PCM input positive (B+).
Negative (BAT-) to PCM input negative (B-).
For two batteries (1S2P, parallel for ~5200mAh), connect both positives to BAT+ and both negatives to BAT-.




Battery Protection Circuit Module (PCM):

Component: 1S 18650 Protection Board (LCSC: C511607)
Symbol: Rectangular block with pins: B+ (battery positive), B- (battery negative), P+ (protected output positive), P- (protected output negative).
Connections:

B+ to BAT+.
B- to BAT-.
P+ to SPDT switch input.
P- to ground plane (GND).




Switch:

Component: SPDT Slide Switch (LCSC: C319441)
Symbol: EasyEDA “SPDT” switch.
Connections:

Common pin to P+ (from PCM).
One throw to circuit positive rail (VCC).
Second throw unconnected or tied to GND.




Polyfuse:

Component: 3A Polyfuse (LCSC: C70374)
Symbol: EasyEDA “Fuse” symbol.
Connections:

Input to VCC (switch output).
Output to LED circuit positive (VCC_PROT).




LED:

Component: XL-2835WWC-02 (LCSC: C2843875)
Symbol: EasyEDA “LED” symbol (3.0–3.4V, 150mA assumed for calculations).
Connections:

Anode to current-limiting resistor output.
Cathode to GND.




Current-Limiting Resistor:

Component: 3.3Ω, 1/4W Resistor (LCSC: C211107)
Symbol: EasyEDA “Resistor” symbol.
Calculation: For V_batt = 3.7V, V_LED = 3.3V, I_LED = 150mA:

R = (3.7V – 3.3V) / 0.15A ≈ 2.67Ω (use 3.3Ω for safety).
Power: (0.4V × 0.15A) = 0.06W (1/4W sufficient).


Connections:

Input to VCC_PROT (polyfuse output).
Output to LED anode.




Capacitor (for stability):

Component: 22µF, 0603 Ceramic Capacitor (LCSC: C216593)
Symbol: EasyEDA “Capacitor” symbol.
Connections:

Across VCC_PROT and GND (parallel to LED circuit).
Optional second capacitor across BAT+ and BAT- for battery input stability.




Optional Charging Module:

Component: TP4056 USB-C Module (LCSC: C2681626)
Symbol: Rectangular block with IN+ (USB-C 5V), IN-, OUT+, OUT-.
Connections:

IN+ to USB-C connector positive (LCSC: C393947).
IN- to GND.
OUT+ to BAT+ (before PCM).
OUT- to BAT- (before PCM).


Note: Ensure PCM and TP4056 are compatible to avoid charging conflicts.




EasyEDA Instructions to Create the Schematic

Open EasyEDA:

Go to easyeda.com and log in or create an account.
Start a new schematic project: File > New > Schematic.


Add Components:

Open the “Library” panel (left sidebar).
Search for components using LCSC part numbers or generic symbols:

Battery: Search “Battery” (set voltage to 3.7V).
PCM: Use a generic 4-pin connector block (label pins B+, B-, P+, P-).
SPDT Switch: Search “SPDT” or “Switch.”
Polyfuse: Search “Fuse.”
LED: Search “LED” (select SMD 2835 footprint for XL-2835WWC-02).
Resistor: Search “Resistor” (0603 or 0805 package).
Capacitor: Search “Capacitor” (0603 package).
TP4056 (optional): Use a 4-pin connector block (label IN+, IN-, OUT+, OUT-).
USB-C Connector (optional): Search “USB-C” or “Connector.”


Place components on the schematic canvas by dragging from the library.


Wire Connections:

Use the “Wire” tool (or press ‘W’) to draw connections:

Battery: BAT+ to PCM B+, BAT- to PCM B-.
PCM: P+ to switch common pin, P- to GND (use EasyEDA’s “GND” symbol).
Switch: Output throw to VCC net (label as “VCC”).
Polyfuse: Input to VCC, output to VCC_PROT net.
Resistor: Input to VCC_PROT, output to LED anode.
LED: Cathode to GND.
Capacitor: Across VCC_PROT and GND.
TP4056 (optional): IN+ to USB-C positive, IN- to GND, OUT+ to BAT+, OUT- to BAT-.


Use “Net Label” tool to label nets (e.g., VCC, VCC_PROT, GND) for clarity.


Annotate and Verify:

Assign component designators (e.g., B1 for battery, R1 for resistor, D1 for LED) using the “Design Manager.”
Run “Design Rule Check” (DRC) in EasyEDA to ensure no open circuits or errors.
Add notes (e.g., “3.3Ω for 150mA”) using the “Text” tool for reference.


Save and Export:

Save the schematic: File > Save.
To create an image for reference:

Go to File > Export > PNG (or take a screenshot).
This generates a visual schematic you can save or print.


Export the BOM: Design > BOM Export to list components for ordering.


PCB Layout (Next Steps):

After completing the schematic, click “Convert to PCB” in EasyEDA.
Place components compactly (e.g., 30x50mm board for UAV).
Route traces (20–30 mil for high-current paths like battery to LED).
Add thermal vias under the LED (use “Via” tool, 0.3mm diameter).
Export Gerber files for JLCPCB fabrication.
